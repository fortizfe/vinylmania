# Specification Quality Checklist: Release Preview Layout Redesign

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Three ambiguities were resolved in the 2026-07-04 clarification session (see spec's Clarifications section): column arrangement (info left / tracklist right), scrollbar-hiding scope (entire preview modal, without changing the shared modal component's default behavior), and tracklist/key-details scroll model (no independently bounded columns; the whole preview scrolls as one unit).
- No outstanding issues; spec is ready for `/speckit-plan`.
